3. FunctionMocker with Examples
   1. Simple function (Doesn’t need a provider)
   2. Complex function (Has multiple use cases)
4. Mockery with Examples
   1. Simple method (Doesn’t need a provider)
   2. SemiComplex method (Has multiple cases, but uses only other methods as its dependencies)
   3. Complex method (Has multiple cases, including other functions as its dependencies)
5. DataProviders with Examples
   1. Using Array syntax
   2. Using Generator syntax
   3. How to benefit from the MockCommonAssertion::doMyMockAssertions helper
